#### :small_red_triangle:What is a server?<br>
A server is a computer program that receives requests from other programs, the client, and sends back a response, e.g. to share data, information or hardware and software resources.<br>

We wrote our `server`, `handlers` and `router` code using modules

#### :small_red_triangle:What is Modules<br>
Modules are just small programs you can integrate with the other programs you are writing. They package programs so that they can be exported to be used by other programs.
We used the following core modules this week:<br>
*`fs` - stands for file system. This module has lots of methods that allow to access files on your computer.<br>

*`http` - allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

*`path` - Node is able to access any file on your computer. To find the correct file you can either give it a relative path or an absolute path.
<br>

*`querystring` - offers methods for you to parse and stringify this type of data.<br>
querystring.parse() - parses query strings into an object <br>

*`url`: splits up a web address into readable parts.<br>
url.parse() - return a URL object with each part of the address as properties <br>
